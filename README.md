# Fully-working-multi-VLAN-secure-corporate-network
Designed and implemented a fully functional multi-VLAN corporate network in Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a real small-to-medium enterprise environment. The network includes HR, IT, and Sales departments, each isolated with VLANs and secured using multiple Layer-2 and Layer-3 security features.
